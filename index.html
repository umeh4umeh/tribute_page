        <p id="tribute-info"><strong>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</strong></p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>1914</strong>  - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
            <li><strong>1933</strong> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth Administration"</li>
            <li><strong></strong><strong></strong></li>
            <li><strong></strong></li>
            <li><strong></strong></li>

            <li><strong></strong></li>
            <
            <li><strong>1962</strong>- Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent 
                in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population</li>
            <li><strong>1970</strong>- receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
            <li><strong>1983</strong>- helps seven African countries dramatically increase theirmaize and sorghum yields</li>
            <li><strong>1984</strong>- becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li>
            <li><strong>2005</strong>- states "we will have to double the world food 
                supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the only 
                way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM 
                crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying 
                plants and animals for a long time. 
                Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li>
            <li><strong>2009</strong>- dies at the age of 95.</li>
        </ul>
